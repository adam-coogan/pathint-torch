# API

The class {class}`pathint_torch.PathIntegralSampler` provides an interface for sampling
the loss for minibatches of trajectories, and generating trajectories along with
their importance weights. The class {class}`pathint_torch.nn.ControlNet` implements
the architecture used for the experiments in the paper.
