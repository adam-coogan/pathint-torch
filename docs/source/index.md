# Welcome to `pathint_torch`'s documentation!

`pathint_torch` is a PyTorch implementation of the [path integral sampler](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.15141),
a method based on the Schr√∂dinger bridge problem for sampling from (unnormalized)
probability densities. Behind the scenes it relies on [torchsde](https://github.com/google-research/torchsde)
to solve stochastic differential equations.
